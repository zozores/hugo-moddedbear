# Hugo moddedBear Theme

## Overview

The Hugo moddedBear theme is a lightweight [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme based on the following:
- [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev)
- [Hugo Bear Blog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog)
- [Bear Cub (from which this theme is forked)](https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub)

This theme has many of the same goals as Bear Blog and the various other themes inspired from it. It's fast and minimal, but it also strives to provide some of the more advanced features many personal bloggers will appreciate out of the box.

When I started my website, I used Jan Raasch's Hugo Bear Blog theme. Over time I found myself overriding the theme to add features and tweaks often enough that it made less and less sense to be using the theme in the first place. I decided to refactor by moving my changes into a proper theme of their own, which is what you're looking at now. In the process, I've tried to make the theme as organized and customizable as possible in case others want to use it or learn from it.

The best place to see the theme in action is on [my website](https://moddedbear.com), though there is an example site included with the theme to help you get started.

## Differences from the Bear Cub theme

Features from the [Bear Cub theme](https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub) have been kept intact unless otherwise noted. These are the notable differences.

### Additions
- Automatic light/dark mode
- Overhauled homepage
  - Avatar image
  - Recent and featured post sections
  - Tag list
  - All features can be individually hidden via config
- Easy theming via CSS properties
  - Copy `/assets/properties.css` from the theme to `/assets` in your site and edit to taste
- Easy Mastodon/Fediverse integration via config
  - Profile verification
  - Author attribution
- Optional table of contents
- External post comments
  - Add a link on your frontmatter to somewhere where people can leave a public comment, like a Mastodon or other social media post
- Anchor links on headings in posts
- RSS feeds for each tag (these were already being generated but are now linked to when filtering by tag)

### Changes
- Tweaked generated social card colors
- Replaced "reply by email" link with generic link to contact page
  - May be better if like me you have multiple forms of contact
- Default config puts blog permalinks at `/` instead of `/blog/`
- Minor style tweaks to taste
